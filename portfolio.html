                        <p> A story driven turn based game combining the gameplay from the
                            old school pokemon games and an original hero's journey kind of story
                            that explores subjects like discrimination, overpopulation, pollution,
                            and the overall problems of a modern superpowered society. The player
                            would create his character, be introduced to the world and discover an
                            adventure. The player would then explore the world and choose his story,
                            either saving the world as a super hero, destroying it as a super villain,
                            or something in between. Check out the story so far

                        <p> Europool suggested this project as a project to do in a class called 
                            "Projeto." In this class, my colleague and I chose this project from 
                            among other different ones. This project consists of developing a prototype 
                            for a simulation for Law Enforcement Agents, experienced or new, in which the 
                            user has to conduct a checkpoint operation. This project was developed in 
                            Unity, and since it was "commissioned" by Europool, I am not certain that I 
                            can link it in this portfolio. However, the report and the code developed 
                            by me can be found

                            WORLD TUNER
                        </h2>
                        <p> A third person platformer made in a week-long game jam in which
                            the theme was, in portuguese "Ambiente". "Ambiente" can be interpreted
                            as either ambient or environment. My team (me and another student) decided to
                            read it as ambient and made a game in which the main character can
                            change the ambient music and control the world. Different musics
                            would have different effects in game and could in theory be used to solve
                            multiple puzzles. In the end, we were able to implement 3 of them and
                            built a small map in order to showcase the possible future game.
                            Eventually we plan on finishing it.
